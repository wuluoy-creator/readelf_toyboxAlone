# readelf_toyboxAlone

This directory contains the source needed to build the single-command Toybox
`readelf` applet used by ksud.

- Upstream: <https://github.com/landley/toybox>
- Android 16 upstream commit: `2cc5e25fb107fe0ff77c95a983474497b76ac9f8`
- AOSP baseline: `android-16.0.0_r1` / Toybox 0.8.12 generation
- License: 0BSD; see `LICENSE`

The snapshot contains upstream `main.c`, `toys.h`, `lib/*`,
`toys/other/readelf.c`, and the generated headers for an `allnoconfig` build
with only `CONFIG_READELF=y` enabled. The corresponding Kconfig output is
stored in `readelf.config`.

ZySU extends the standalone project with
`include/readelf_toybox_api.h`: a versioned, reentrant C API that returns a
fixed-width ELF-header structure without using stdio, process exits, or
Toybox global state. The header decoder was extracted from Toybox readelf and
the command-line applet now consumes the same API, so ksud does not carry a
second parser. The extension also preserves the full 64-bit ELF entry point.

The CMake target compiles the upstream CLI into a private static archive.
Every symbol defined by that archive is rewritten with the
`zysu_toybox_` prefix before linking, preventing collisions with the BusyBox
implementation already linked into ksud. The structured API is built as a
separate core target with uniquely prefixed symbols. `ksud readelf` dispatches
to the namespaced Toybox entry point, while the ramdisk editor calls the
structured API directly.
